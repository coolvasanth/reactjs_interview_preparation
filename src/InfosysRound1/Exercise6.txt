Why Fetch Inside useEffect? 

1. We typically fetch data inside useEffect in React because it ensures 
the data is fetched only when the component is mounted (or when 
dependencies in the array change). 
2. This prevents unnecessary re-renders on every update and improves performance. 
3. Additionally, useEffect allows for easy cleanup of side effects 
like subscriptions when the component unmounts.
