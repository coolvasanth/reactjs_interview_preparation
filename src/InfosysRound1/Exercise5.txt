Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, including React. It provides a centralized store to hold application state, actions to update that state, and reducers to handle those updates.
	• Store: Holds the entire application state as a single JavaScript object tree.
	• Actions: Plain JavaScript objects describing the intention to change the state.
	• Reducers: Pure functions that accept the current state and an action, returning the new state.
Pros of Redux:
	• Predictable State Management: Easier to reason about application state and track changes.
	• Improved Testability: Easier to test components in isolation due to centralized state.
	• Scalability: Well-suited for large and complex applications.
Cons of Redux:
	• Boilerplate Code: Requires setting up stores, reducers, actions, and middleware.
	• Complexity: Learning curve for managing state with reducers and actions.
